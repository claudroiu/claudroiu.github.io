I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Free University of Bolzano-Bozen](https://www.unibz.it/en/), under the supervision of [Francesco Ravazzolo](http://www.francescoravazzolo.com/). My research interests are in macroeconomics with a particular emphasis on the interaction between fiscal policy and monetary policy. Previously, I worked as an intern in the Monetary Policy and Analysis Division at the Deutsche Bundesbank.

### Working Papers

[**On the Interactions between Money Supply and Fiscal Stimuli**](https://github.com/claudroiu/claudroiu.github.io/blob/master/files/InteractionsMoneySupplyFiscalStimuli_06072023.pdf)
<a href="[https://www.google.com/](https://github.com/claudroiu/claudroiu.github.io/blob/master/files/InteractionsMoneySupplyFiscalStimuli_06072023.pdf)" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">custom link</a> (with [Marco Lorusso](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/business/people/profile/marcolorusso.html) and [Francesco Ravazzolo](http://www.francescoravazzolo.com/)) <br>
In this paper we quantitatively evaluate an alternative way of public debt financing. Specifically, we develop and estimate a New Keynesian model to analyse the effects of a fiscal stimulus that is financed by money supply, and does not result in an increase in public debt. Through our impulse response analysis, we find a positive impact of monetary-financing on economic aggregates. The paper contributes to the literature by providing a quantitative counterfactual analysis of utilizing the money supply to finance fiscal stimuli. 


[**Public Debt, Fiscal Policy and Velocity**](https://github.com/claudroiu/claudroiu.github.io/blob/master/files/Velocity_and_public_debt_expectations_V2.pdf) (with [Stefan Franz Schubert](https://www.unibz.it/it/faculties/economics-management/academic-staff/person/8367-stefan-franz-schubert)) <br>
This work explores the relationship between the public debt-to-GDP ratio and the velocity of money zero maturity (MZM) in the United States. Our findings suggest that the public debt-to-GDP ratio Granger causes velocity from 1959Q1 to 2019Q4. To further investigate these findings, we analyse this relationship through the lens of a New Keynesian model with fiscal policy shocks. Nominal rigidities play a key role in shaping our results. This analysis contributes to literature by introducing a determinant of money velocity, offering insights into the transmission mechanisms of fiscal policy shocks.


**The Macroeconomic Effects of Income Taxes on Labour Markets** (with [Aicha Kharazi](https://sites.google.com/view/aichakharazi/home) and [Francesco Ravazzolo](http://www.francescoravazzolo.com/)) <br>
This work examines the effects of income taxation on the labour market and its role in explaining hours worked dynamics. We construct a Real Business Cycle (RBC) model with two agents. Through impulse response functions, we show that a shock to income taxes affects differently the two agents, suggesting a heterogeneous and negative response of labour supply. To test these results, the paper provides microeconomic evidence from the US Current Population Survey, which indicates that high-income individuals are taxed proportionally less than low-income individuals. Additionally, we find that the labour elasticity with respect to income tax is positive.
