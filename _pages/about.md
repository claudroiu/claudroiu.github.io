I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano. My research interests are in macroeconomics with a specific emphasis on the interplay between fiscal policy and monetary policy. I am currently interested in the macroeconometric modeling of climate change and extreme events. I obtained my PhD in Economics in January 2024 from the [Free University of Bolzano-Bozen](https://www.unibz.it/en/). During my doctoral studies, I worked as an intern in the Monetary Policy and Analysis Division at the Deutsche Bundesbank.

### Working Papers

[**Is monetary-financing a valuable alternative to debt-financing in response to fiscal stimuli?**](https://github.com/claudroiu/claudroiu.github.io/blob/master/files/MonFin_LoRussoRavazzoloUdroiu.pdf) (with [Marco Lorusso](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/business/people/profile/marcolorusso.html) and [Francesco Ravazzolo](http://www.francescoravazzolo.com/)) <br>
In this paper we quantitatively evaluate an alternative way of public debt financing. Specifically, we develop and estimate a New Keynesian model to analyse the effects of a fiscal stimulus that is financed by money supply, and does not result in an increase in public debt. Through our impulse response analysis, we find a positive impact of monetary-financing on economic aggregates. The paper contributes to the literature by providing a quantitative counterfactual analysis of utilizing the money supply to finance fiscal stimuli. <br>

[**Public Debt and Velocity**](https://github.com/claudroiu/claudroiu.github.io/blob/master/files/Public_debt_and_velocity.pdf) (with [Stefan Franz Schubert](https://www.unibz.it/it/faculties/economics-management/academic-staff/person/8367-stefan-franz-schubert)) <br>
This work explores the relationship between the public debt-to-GDP ratio and the velocity of money zero maturity (MZM) in the United States. Our findings suggest that the public debt-to-GDP ratio Granger causes velocity from 1959Q1 to 2019Q4. To further investigate these findings, we analyse this relationship through the lens of a New Keynesian model with fiscal policy shocks. This analysis contributes to literature by introducing a determinant of money velocity, offering insights into the transmission mechanisms of fiscal policy shocks. <br>

[**The Macroeconomic Effects of Income Taxes on Labour Markets**](https://github.com/claudroiu/claudroiu.github.io/blob/master/files/IncomeTaxes_Kharazi_Ravazzolo_Udroiu.pdf) (with [Aicha Kharazi](https://sites.google.com/view/aichakharazi/home) and [Francesco Ravazzolo](http://www.francescoravazzolo.com/)) <br>
This work examines the effects of income taxation on the labour market and its role in explaining hours worked dynamics. We construct a Real Business Cycle (RBC) model with two agents. Through impulse response functions, we show that a shock to income taxes affects differently the two agents, suggesting a heterogeneous and negative response of labour supply. To test these results, the paper provides microeconomic evidence from the US Current Population Survey, which indicates that high-income individuals are taxed proportionally less than low-income individuals. Additionally, we find that the labour elasticity with respect to income tax is positive. <br>
